Welcome to **Mare Blog**! This post serves as a complete walkthrough to help you set up, customize, and maintain your new blog. Whether you are modifying global configurations, managing your pages, or creating fresh content, you will find all the essential steps below.

## 1. Configuring Your Site

All global site metadata and third-party integrations (such as the Giscus comment system) are managed inside `/site.config.ts`.

Open `/site.config.ts` and update the values to match your personal details:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  siteTitle: "Mare Blog",
  author: "Niceeepoiu",
  authorUrl: "https://github.com/Niceeepoiu",

  giscus: {
    enable: false,
    repo: "your-username/your-repo-name",
    repoId: "YOUR_GISCUS_REPO_ID",
    category: "Announcements",
    categoryId: "YOUR_GISCUS_CATEGORY_ID",
    theme: "light",
    lang: "en",
  },
});
```

### Configuration Options Breakdown

#### Main Site Metadata

- **`siteTitle`**: Sets the global display name for your blog across the header.
- **`author`**: The default author name displayed on blog posts and footer copyright notices.
- **`authorUrl`**: The link attached to the author's name (e.g., your personal website or GitHub profile).

#### Giscus Comment System Settings

- **`enable`**: Toggle `true` to enable or `false` to globally disable the comment widget on blog posts.
- **`repo`**: Your GitHub repository path in `owner/repo` format where comments will be stored as Discussions.
- **`repoId`**: The unique GraphQL Node ID of your target GitHub repository.
- **`category`**: The target GitHub Discussion category name (e.g., `Announcements`).
- **`categoryId`**: The unique GraphQL Node ID of your chosen Discussion category.
- **`theme`**: The visual theme for the Giscus comment box (e.g., `light`, `dark`, `preferred_color_scheme`).
- **`lang`**: The interface language tag for the Giscus widget UI (e.g., `en`, `zh-CN`, `ja`).

## 2. Modifying the About Page

The About page content is managed via Markdown and located at `src/content/about.md`.

To update your personal bio:

1. Open the About Markdown file.
2. Update the Frontmatter metadata at the top if needed.
3. Edit the Markdown body below the Frontmatter to update your personal intro, project showcase, or social media links.

```markdown
---
title: "Title"
description: "description..."
---

Write your Markdown content here.
```

## 3. Writing & Publishing Posts

Blog articles live inside the content directory: `src/content/blog/`.

To publish a new article:

1. Create a new `.md` or `.mdx` file in `src/content/blog/` (e.g., `my-first-post.md`).
2. Add the required Frontmatter metadata at the top of the file:

```markdown
---
title: "Blog Title"
description: "description..."
pubDate: 2026-08-30
---

Write your Markdown content here.
```

The new post will automatically appear on your homepage and blog list.

## 4. Commands
